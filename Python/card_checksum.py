# There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so card numbers are pretty long.
# Credit card numbers actually have some structure to them. All American Express numbers start with 34 or 37;
# most MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 and all Visa numbers start with 4.
# But credit card numbers also have a �checksum� built into them, a mathematical relationship between
# at least one number and others. That checksum enables computers to detect typos (e.g., transpositions),
# if not fraudulent numbers, without having to query a database, which can be slow

# Using Luhn's Algorithm
