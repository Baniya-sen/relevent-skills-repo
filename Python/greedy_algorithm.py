# Implementing Greedy Algorithm, using money change given. When making change, odds are you want to minimize the
# number of coins youï¿½re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out. Fortunately, computer science has given
# cashiers everywhere ways to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy algorithms.

# Output is calculated on Quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennie. where 1 is a dollar that generates 4 coins(quarters).
